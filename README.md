# Week-1
Water Quality Prediction project for the Edunet Foundation | Shell | AICTE Virtual Internship. This Week 1 submission includes data exploration and problem definition using a water potability dataset.

In this Week 1 milestone of the internship, I explored a dataset related to water quality. The goal was to predict whether water is safe for drinking based on chemical properties like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, and more.
I used Python and Pandas in Google Colab to:

Load the dataset (water_potability.csv)

Display the first few rows

Check data types and structure

Generate summary statistics

Identify missing values

Define a clear problem statement related to sustainability (UN SDG 6)

This sets the foundation for building a machine learning model in the upcoming weeks.
